literally the most simple thing i've ever done. basically just a browser extension that opens YouTube tabs infinitely if installed to your browser. 

the only way to get rid of it is going to your browsers local files and removing the extension yourself, because if you dont, chrome/opera/whatever will spam tabs and freeze/crash.


to install into chrome, you have to go to chrome://extensions and turn on developer mode (top right), then click "Load Unpacked"
i believe its the same way for other browsers, but I do know its the exact same for Opera GX

boom. your ram dies. not really, but yknow.
